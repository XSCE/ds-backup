several ways. We are happy to receive:

  1) a link to your clone of the olpc-netutils repository and a summary of what
     you'd like us to examine in it

  2) an emailed patch, preferably indicating the commit to which the patch
     should be applied

  3) general comments, questions, and reviews in any medium
