## NOTE: incrond v0.5.5 cannot cope with
## comments in its "tab" files. So we
## put them here, until incrontab gets
## better at this :-)

# We monitor create and move to, because
# while touch/echo will trigger IN_CREATE,
# rsync transfers (use the -T flag!) will
# create the file in a tempdir and then mv
# it into place. Again: use rsync -T /tmp
#                     : martin@laptop.org
